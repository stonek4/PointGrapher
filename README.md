# PointGrapher
a script to graph 802.11 point data in json format


## Run It

```
$ python pointgraph.py out.json out0.json distance_ft transferred_mbytes
```

Where:
- __out.json__ is the first data set
- __out0.json__ is the second data set
- __distance_ft__ is the x axis data
- __transferred_mbytes__ is the y axis data

## Other Thoughts

- Would be nice for this to take a file list as an argument so that more than two data sets can be compared
